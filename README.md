### Is this workshop for me?
If you are fairly new to (or would like to get into) programming and app development, this may be a great fit for you - especially if you have not yet used version control tools.  This workshop may be beneficial to those who have used Git but would like to better understand how it works.

### What you'll need
- A laptop with [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed
- A GitHub account ([you can create one for free](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github))
- An appetite (we'll have pizza and beverages available)
- A desire to learn!

__Don't have a laptop to use?__ No worries; we'll have extra machines available for you to borrow for the workshop.  Just let us know you need one when you RSVP for the event.

### What you'll learn
- The basic concepts of Git and why version control is important
- [Basic commands](https://git-scm.com/docs) such as `status`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `clone`, `branch`, and more
- How to use Git-powered platforms to perform a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

### Contributing to this repo
There are two ways you can contribute to this repo:  as a collaborator of the repo itself, or by forking the repo.

#### As a collaborator
This requires direct access to the repo.  Steps:

- Send your GitHub username to contact@slothwerks.com along with a request for collaboration on the `git-workshop` repo
- Watch for an email invitation to join the `git-workshop` repo as a collaborator
- View and accept the invitation on GitHub

Now you may work on the codebase directly:

- [Clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and create a new branch from `staging` with needed changes
- Once your work is complete, push your changes up to the remote repository (this may require you to [set up authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication) based on how you cloned the repo)
- [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) within GitHub targeting the `staging` branch
- Once the PR has been approved, [merge the code](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request) and delete the branch

#### As a non-collaborator
You may also contribute without being added as a member of the collaborative team.  In this case, you'll submit pull requests using a forked copy of the repo.  In short:

- You'll create a copy of the repo and save it to your GitHub account.
- This forked copy can be synched with the original, so you can be sure to have the latest updates.
- You may submit pull requests targeting the default `staging` branch.

GitHub has some [excellent documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) for how to fork a public repo and submit a pull request.  When creating the forked copy, the `staging` branch will automatically be chosen as the default branch.
